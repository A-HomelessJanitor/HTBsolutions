  solutions
  netstat -ln4 | grep "LISTEN" | grep -v "127" | wc -l ( the 'l' in the flag means interface table for Iface and n4 means dont resolve DNS hostnames only use ipv4
  use "ps -e | grep 'ftp' " to get the process number then use "ps -eLf | grep "(num)" " to get the user name as -eLf flag gives more info on the process
  curl https://www.inlanefreight.com | tr ' ' '\n' | grep 'https://www.inlanefreight.com' | tr "'" '"' | cut -d '"' -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l
    1. Curl the domain 
    2. turn all whitespaces into new lines 
    3. grab all of the lines that contain that string 
    4. Turn all single quote characters into double quotes
    5. get all info that are inbetween double quotes (") and pipe them 
    6. do a standard sort of info 
    7. remove all duplicate lines with uniq 
    8. count how many lines there are
