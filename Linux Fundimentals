# Filter Contents #
  more  read contents of a file and can scroll
  less  same as more but lines disapear after exiting
  head  reads first 10 lines of a file
  tail  read last 10 lines of a file
  sort  sort the desired results alphabetically or numerically
  grep  only read lines in a file that have content you want
  cut   read contents of lines after something like ":" so if the line was "password:abcdefg" then it would return "abcdefg"
  tr    replace content in a line with one you specify ie. turn any ":" into a space when displaying the read
  column display more information about files and also oragnise them in a more readable way
  awk   display the first ($1) and last ($NF) result of the line
  sed   uses regex to subsitute specified objects from defines patterns
  wc    used to count items or lines in a file

    Solutions
    netstat -ln4 | grep "LISTEN" | grep -v "127" | wc -l ( the 'l' in the flag means interface table for Iface and n4 means dont resolve DNS hostnames only use ipv4
    use "ps -e | grep 'ftp' " to get the process number then use "ps -eLf | grep "(num)" " to get the user name as -eLf flag gives more info on the process
    curl https://www.inlanefreight.com | tr ' ' '\n' | grep 'https://www.inlanefreight.com' | tr "'" '"' | cut -d '"' -f2 | sort | uniq | wc -l
      1. Curl the domain 
      2. turn all whitespaces into new lines 
      3. grab all of the lines that contain that string 
      4. Turn all single quote characters into double quotes
      5. get all info that are inbetween double quotes (") and pipe them 
      6. do a standard sort of info 
      7. remove all duplicate lines with uniq 
      8. count how many lines there are

# Regular Expressions #
    1	(a)	The round brackets are used to group parts of a regex. Within the brackets, you can define further patterns which should be processed together.
    2	[a-z]	The square brackets are used to define character classes. Inside the brackets, you can specify a list of characters to search for.
    3	{1,10}	The curly brackets are used to define quantifiers. Inside the brackets, you can specify a number or a range that indicates how often a previous pattern should be repeated.
    4	|	Also called the OR operator and shows results when one of the two expressions matches
    5	.*	Also called the AND operator and displayed results only if both expressions match

# User Management #
  sudo	Execute command as a different user.
  su	The su utility requests appropriate user credentials via PAM and switches to that user ID (the default user is the superuser). A shell is then executed.

  userdel	Deletes a user account and related files.
  usermod	Modifies a user account.
  addgroup	Adds a group to the system.
  delgroup	Removes a group from the system.
